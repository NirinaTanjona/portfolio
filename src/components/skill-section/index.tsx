      <p>
        As I said above I am a full stack developer, whitch means I can create
        both server-side and client-side applications. For server-side or
        "backend" in IT jargon, I mostly use <strong>node js</strong> for simple
        projects, but when the project is in large scale I prefer{" "}
        <strong>ruby on rails</strong>. For client side, I use{" "}
        <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next js</strong>, for their
        simplicity, elegance and readability.
